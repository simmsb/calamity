## 0.2.0.1

+ Fix a bug causing member objects sent alongside messages to not parse correctly.

## 0.2.0.0

+ Remove all usages of lazy Text (except from typeclass instances) 
+ Fix a bug that caused http request decoding to never select the `()` instance
  for decoding the response (which meant endpoints that had empty responses
  would always fail to parse).
+ Bumped the minimum version of aeson to 2.0

## 0.1.31.0

+ We now pass through the `.member` field of message create/update events to the
  event handler.
+ The payload type of `MessageCreateEvt` has changed from `Message` to
  `(Message, Maybe User, Maybe Member)`.
+ The payload type of `MessageUpdateEvt` has changed from `(Message, Message)`
  to `(Message, Message, Maybe User, Maybe Member)`.
+ The payload type of `RawMessageUpdateEvt` has changed from `UpdatedMessage` to
  `(UpdatedMessage, Maybe User, Maybe Member)`.
+ The provided `ConstructContext` effect handlers have changed from handling
  `ConstructContext Message ...` to `ConstructContext (Message, User, Maybe
  Member) ...`.
+ `FullContext` now uses the member passed with the message create event if
  available.
+ `LightContext` now has a `.member` parameter, which is the member passed with
  the message create event if available. The `userID` field has also been
  replaced with `user :: User`.
+ `CommandNotFound` now contains the `User` and `Maybe Member` of the message
  create event that triggered it.

## 0.1.30.4

+ The `status` field of `StatusUpdateData` has been changed from `Text` to
  `StatusType`.
+ Removed the redundant `Typeable` constraint from `BotC` and `runBotIO`, etc.
+ Added the `runBotIO''` function which gives more control over the internal
  state effects.

  (these are still WIP in this version).

  no parameters.

+ Removed the re-export of `CalamityCommands.ParsePrefix` from Calamity.Commands.
+ Added the `Calamity.Commands.Utils.useConstantPrefix` method.

## 0.1.30.0

  @"command-error" @(FullContext, CommandError)` it is now `'CustomEvt
  (CtxCommandError FullContext)`, etc.
+ Added `embedFooter`, `embedImage`, `embedThumbnail`, `embedAuthor`, and
  `embedField` utility functions.
+ Added `Default` instances for `EmbedAuthor`.
+ Corrected the nullability of `EmbedImage`, `EmbedThumbnail`, `EmbedVideo`, and
  `EmbedProvider`.
+ Changed the command parameter machinery to hold more info about parameters.
+ Added a 'type cheatsheet' thing to command help in the default help command.
+ Calamity now uses and re-exports the Calamity-Commands package instead of
  having all the code duplicated.
+ An extra effect now needs to be handled for commands: `ConstructContext`, this
  also allows you to change which context your bot uses.
+ `Calamity.Commands.Context.Context` has been removed, instead use
  `FullContext`, `LightContext`, or make your own.
  
## 0.1.29.0
